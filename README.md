# h1 Roblox-Doors-Auto-A-1000-Original

Description: This Repo will have the original Auto A-1000 script for Roblox doors by Geodude. As the name suggests, it auto-completes doors ROOMS using pathfinding services and auto-hides when entities come. A-90 also doesn't spawn, as the module is deleted when the script is run.

Instructions: 
I will include the script as a Lua file but for people who are directly executing using the Lua file, I'll also include a text file with the script so you can just copy and paste the script into your executor I'll also add a loadstring for mobile script executes like Delta.

Important: 
This script is now over a year old, glitchy, and may break. For this reason, if you go to my repos, I'll make a new one with a modified and enhanced version of this script at "https://github.com/DisguisedBadgerOfficial/Doors-Auto-A-1000-New". 
Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!
